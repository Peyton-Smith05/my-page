## Objective

As a skilled and driven computer engineer, my objective is to leverage my expertise in software development, systems architecture, and problem-solving to contribute to innovative technology solutions. With a strong foundation in Python, C++, hardware design and a passion for cutting-edge advancements, I aim to collaborate with passionate teams to design and develop advanced technologies in AI, robotics, and space. My goal is to apply my passion, effective cooperation, and continuous learning to create impactful and meaningful work in these industries.

## Education

I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University in May of 2024. I have a strong foundation in computer engineering concepts, gained through coursework and hands-on projects. While attending Texas A&M University I had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester at Singapore Technology and Design. There, I had the opportunity to study Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under a MIT designed curriculum. I collaborated with peers from all parts of the world to complete challenging projects in these subjects. My education has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application, positioning me for success in the field of computer engineering.

## Interests

In my personal life, I have a few hobbies that bring me satisfaction and relaxation. Rock climbing is one of my favorite things to do after work and on the weekends. It is an invigorating activity that allows me to challenge myself physically and immerse in nature. Photography is another pastime that challenges me creatively and is my favorite way to enjoy a new place when traveling. Additionally, I always enjoy a good movie. You will find me keeping up with the most recent content from noteworthy directors and franchises. These hobbies add a sense of fulfillment and variety to my everyday life, making it enjoyable through exploration and self-expression.

## Volunteerism

Volunteer work and charity is an important value of mine. There are many ways to perform volunteer work, all of which are crucial. Mental health is the avenue that I find most fulfilling and impactful, being that I see mental health challenges affect friends, family, and even myself. It is something everyone will encounter one way or another in this life. Below are experiences, current and past, that I support.

### [Texas A&M HelpLine](https://caps.tamu.edu/helpline/#:~:text=The%20HelpLine%20phone%20number%20979,undergraduate%2C%20graduate%20and%20former%20students.) 

HelpLine exists to be an after-hours mental health service for Texas A&M University. They seek to provide a free confidential, non-judgemental, safe place for students to go to for any mental health related topics. They provide peer support, information, crisis intervention, and referrals to students. As a volunteer, I aided my peers by providing them a listening ear through this service. It has brought immense satisfaction to my life being able to support people when they do not feel they have that in their lives.

### [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://new.churchofjesuschrist.org/?s_tnt=151615%3A0%3A0&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D341BD07BABA1D5F4-13C5BB02FB494918%7CMCORGID%3D66C5485451E56AAE0A490D45%40AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1691356447&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fnew.churchofjesuschrist.org%2F&lang=eng)

Another important facet of my life is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Being a member, I had the privilege to serve as a full-time volunteer Missionary in Brazil, Cuiaba. From August 2018 to March 2020 I was able to serve, teach, and lead in this area of the world about Christ. We served the local community by organizing and completing service projects, getting to know local members, and serving in volunteer positions at the local church. There I had the opportunity to meet some of the most amazing people. They were always willing to serve and help us too when we needed help. It was an amazing experience that taught me so much compassion, perspective, and humility.
