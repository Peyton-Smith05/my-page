## About the Company

AKW Ventures LLC, SAAS company run by [Chris Wilke](https://www.chriswilke.net/), seeks to provide quality software in areas needed. One of its core products is the [College Footballer App](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/college-footballer/id1028810756). This app provides the times, channels, rosters, and live score for customers. The user is able to customize and follow their favorite teams and have their stats easily available. 

## Role

As a developer on the team for College Footballer, I worked on a small team to update and improve the existing code base of the College Football schedules app suite. I assisted in creating recurring revenue by implementing a subscription popup with Revenue Cat and SwiftUI. 

Additionally, I helped automate data processing to retrieve live information for users. By utilizing cron on Unix I was able to automate schedules tasks or scripts to be run at needed times in order to update live score information.
