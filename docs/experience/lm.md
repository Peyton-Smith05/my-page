## Role

My role was an intern on the Sensor Fusion team for airframes. While working as an intern I was trained in the fundamental concepts of sensor fusion such as the Kalman Filter, Global Nearest Neighbor, and frames of reference. These algorithms are fundamental to data association and sensor tracking. 

I additionally supported the team by developing an application to analyze a software libraries architecture based off of principles of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by Bob Martin. By creating this application, I developed a solid understanding of the principles behind good architecture design. These principles include circular dependencies, instability, abstractness, and encapsulation. 

While developing this tool I worked effectively in a team of 6. We utilized the Agile development framework to complete tasks according to the product owners needs, planed sprints, demonstrated complete products, and evaluated teams effectiveness.
