# AggieSat Laboratory

### **CDH Team Leader**, *August 2021 - February 2022*

## About the Organization

[AggieSat Laboratory](https://aggiesat.tamu.edu/) is a student-run space program that seeks to give students hands-on experience in working with space systems. They have put two satellites into orbit since being created and competed for over 10 grants. They currently have 5 active projects in development.

## Role

NASA sent out a request for proposals for a $2 million grant for an autonomous lunar rover. I was apart of Aggie Sat's ALARM project. This was an Autonomous Lunar Regolith Manipulator. Its purpose was to be deployed to prepare lunar regolith for a rocket to land on. It is essentially an autonomous lunar bull dozer. 

Aggie Sat had submitted a proposal and I was on the Command and Data Handling (CDH) team for this project. We performed preliminary design work on the rover by creating FDIR documents that conceptualized the requirements for the CDH sub-system on board the rover. During this time I was promoted to CDH Team Lead and managed the sub team in completing weekly tasks.
